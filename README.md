# Extension-Twitch-LowLatency

This is the source code of the Chrome extension "Twitch Low Latency"

### Description:

Minimize the latency of the lives on Twitch (and not only) by clicking on the button to participate in real time with the community!

This extension ignores the loaded buffer and jumps directly to the most recent streamed video possible.
